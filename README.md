# Pipelined Processor RISC-V Instructions

## Project Overview

This project aims to design and implement a pipelined processor that executes RISC-V instructions. The primary objectives are to achieve high performance through pipeline stages, ensure proper instruction handling, and manage hazards efficiently. This README provides an overview of the project structure, setup instructions, and a brief explanation of the key components involved in the design.
