# Pipelined Processor RISC-V Instructions

## Project Overview

This project aims to design and implement a pipelined processor that executes RISC-V instructions. The primary objectives are to achieve high performance through pipeline stages, ensure proper instruction handling, and manage hazards efficiently. This README provides an overview of the project structure, setup instructions, and a brief explanation of the key components involved in the design.

## Features

- **Five-stage pipeline**: Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write Back (WB).
- **Hazard detection and forwarding**: Efficient management of data and control hazards.
- **Support for RISC-V base integer instruction set (RV32I)**.
- **Simulation and testing environment**: Scripts and tools to test the processor with various instruction sets.
